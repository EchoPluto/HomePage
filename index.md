I am Hengjia Li, a Ph.D. student at [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/index.html), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Deng Cai](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/) and [Prof. Xiaofei He](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/xiaofeihe/). 
Before that, I received my B.Eng. in [Mathematical Sciences](http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/) of [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/).
Currently, I have the privilege of being a visiting student at [Human Sensing Lab](http://www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu/) of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), working under the guidance of Prof. [Fernando De La Torre](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ftorre/).

My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, with a recent focus on 2D/Video/3D generative models.
