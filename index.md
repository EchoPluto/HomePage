## Hello 👋!

I am Hengjia Li, a Ph.D. student at [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/index.html), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Deng Cai](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/) and [Prof. Xiaofei He](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/xiaofeihe/). 
Before that, I received my B.Eng. in Mathematical Sciences of Zhejiang University.
And I am fortunate to be a research intern and collaborate with [Liming Jiang](https://liming-jiang.com/) at Tiktok, [Shiwei Zhang](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Shiwei_Zhang2) at [Tongyi WanX](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/wanxiang/), [Yi Ren](https://rayeren.github.io/) at [Heygen](https://www.heygen.com/), and [Hongwei Yi](https://xyyhw.top/) at [Hedra](https://www.hedra.com/).
I also have the privilege of being a visiting scholar at [Human Sensing Lab](http://www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu/) of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), working under the guidance of Prof. [Fernando De La Torre](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ftorre/).

My research interests include multi-modal image and video generative models, with a recent focus on post training.

*I am actively looking for a full-time research scientist position in industry starting from 2026. Please feel free to reach out if there is a good match.*
