## Hello ðŸ‘‹!

I am Hengjia Li, a Ph.D. student at [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/index.html), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Deng Cai](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/) and [Prof. Xiaofei He](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/xiaofeihe/). 
Before that, I received my B.Eng. in Mathematical Sciences of Zhejiang University.
And I am fortunate to collaborate with [Hongwei Yi](https://xyyhw.top/) at [Hedra](https://www.hedra.com/) and [Shiwei Zhang](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Shiwei_Zhang2) at [Tongyi](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/wanxiang/).
Currently, I have the privilege of being a visiting scholar at [Human Sensing Lab](http://www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu/) of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), working under the guidance of Prof. [Fernando De La Torre](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ftorre/).

My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, with a recent focus on multi-modal image and video generative models.
